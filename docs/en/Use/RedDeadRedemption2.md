## Installing Mods

You can download any Mods you want from various websites. Here are a few websites for downloading Cyberpunk 2077 Mods:

- 3DM Mods: https://mod.3dmgame.com/RDR2
- Nexus Mods: https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/mods/

Then, add the downloaded compressed package to the manager for automatic installation and uninstallation.

## Removing Directory Permissions

If your game is downloaded from the R* platform, you need to remove the directory's permissions.

> You can check if the directory needs permissions by looking for the "Administrator" flag next to "Delete" when right-clicking the game's executable program.

To remove permissions:
1. Right-click on the folder's blank space and select "Properties",
2. Choose "Security" -> "Edit",
3. Find "Users", check "Full Control",
4. Click "Apply".

## Game Won't Open After Installing the Prerequisite

In the prerequisite package, there's something called "ModLoader". This is an lml type of prerequisite file.

But the ModLoader I published only supports the latest official game. If you have a different version, it might cause the game not to open.

Then, you have a few choices:
- Purchase the official game
- Find a ModLoader that supports your game version
- Uninstall ModLoader
  - Uninstalling ModLoader will cause all lml type Mods to become ineffective
