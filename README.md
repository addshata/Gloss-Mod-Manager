### Help with Translation
If you are willing to help us translate GMM into your language, you can do the following:

- Click "Export language package" in [Settings](#/Settings).
- The exported language pack will be in `My Documents\Gloss Mod Manager\lang`.
- Copy a language you're familiar with (we prioritize Simplified Chinese and English language packs).
- Rename it with your language code and add it to the `lang.json` file (be sure to follow the json format specifications).
- Press `Ctrl + R` in the manager to reload the manager and see your text in the language list on the settings page.
- Open `*.json` files with your favorite editor and translate.
- You can always press `Ctrl + R` to reload the manager to immediately view the translation.
- After completion, you can send the translated files to me via email at `mod@3dmgame.com` or `xm@aoe.top`. 
- Remember to include the language you translated and your credit in the email.
